# ASP.net Core Contacts Manager

This is just a very basic application built on ASP.net Yo and Microsofts' MVC. Mostly just a learning resource for me so I could introduce myself to ASP. Based of off [a scotch school class](https://school.scotch.io/build-a-contact-list-with-aspnet-core). 

To install you'll need asp.net core and Yo then:
1. CD into the project directory
2. Run `dotnet restore` 
3. Run `npm install` 
4. Run `dotnet watch run`
5. Any issues, report them [here](https://github.com/blakethepatton/asp.net-ContactManager/issues) and I'll try to help if I can. (asp noob)
